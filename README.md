# PJAIT Fundamentals of Python Programming Final Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images using the Keras library. The approach achieves high accuracy in classifying images into predefined categories, showcasing the effectiveness of CNNs for image recognition tasks. It was completed as part of the Fundamentals of Python Programming (PPY) course during my Computer Science studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJAIT).
